According to WHO's report, in China approximately 740 million nonsmokers, including 180 million children, are taking in secondhand smoke more than once a day. Moreover, approximately 100,000 people die in China every year as a result of secondhand smoke. Becourse of this severe situation, the Chinese government is considering a national law banning on smoking in public spots. This law have gained univeral support amoung both nonsmokers and smokers. Despite that certain Chinese citites have banned smoking in public spots, these regulations are rarely implemented. Thus, more stringent laws are required to prevent nonsmokers from the risk of smoking.
