In the past 2000 years, the large number of small-plot farmers have supplied the whole China with most of food required. Recent statistic has shown that there are 22 million farm workers in China as of 2014. Despite the large number of farm workers, the aging of the current generation of farmers and the lack of the next generation will result in much fewer farmers in China than before. To address this problem, central Chinese government released its proposal for new Five-Year Plan last week. This proposal includes a number of policies aiming at promoting large farms and highly skilled farmers. These policies indicate the beginning of second major period of agricultural reform of China. It is considered that this reform will increase both the productivity and the profit of agricultural industry.
